## 1. Apply App Theme

This option injects JavaScript that sets `prefers-color-scheme` according to
your selected Webview Kiosk theme.  
It keeps the webpage theme consistent with the app's theme.  

This script runs immediately **on page start**.

If the theme is the default **System**, this script is a no-op (does nothing).

**Default:** true

## 2. Apply Desktop Viewport Width (px)

This script injects JavaScript code that sets document.meta.content to
`width=YOUR_WIDTH_VALUE`, simulating web browsing on a Desktop.

JS history state changes will also be subscribed to (e.g. from Single Page
Applications), and the script will be re-triggered as needed.

You should only enable this option if setting the user agent was insufficient
to force Desktop mode, as the additional JS here will slow down the page.

You may also want to enable the following options under
`Settings -> Web Engine`:

- User Agent: Desktop
- Use Wide Viewport: `True`
- Load with Overview Mode: `True`
- Enable Zoom: `True`


To disable, use the value `0`.

**Minimum:**: 640

**Default:** 0

## 3. Custom Scripts

Your code content will be wrapped as follows to prevent polluting the global
scope and avoid conflicts with other scripts:

```javascript
(function() {
    // <YOUR CODE>
})()
```

**Example:**

```javascript
document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'green';
```

### 3.1. On Page Start

JavaScript to run immediately when the page starts loading.

Useful for early DOM manipulation or overriding functions.

**Default:** *(blank)*

### 3.2. On Page Finish

JavaScript to run after the page has fully loaded.  

Useful for DOM updates, styling, or injecting behavior.

**Default:** *(blank)*
