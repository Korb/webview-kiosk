import { EllipsisVertical, Wrench } from 'lucide-react';

On the home settings page clicking the <span className="inline-flex">(<EllipsisVertical />)</span> icon
will show the options:

1. Import
1. Export

When selecting `Export`, a dialog will appear displaying a `JSON` string encoded with `Base64`.
This string contains all currently saved user settings.

To import this value, you can simply paste the string in the `Import` dialog, which will restore
the exported settings.
