See also: `Settings -> JS Scripts -> Apply App Theme`.

1. Shown  

With `Hidden when locked`, the address bar will be visible in the default view,

<span className="inline-flex">(<Wrench className="-rotate-90"/>)</span>.

## 3. Window Insets

Controls padding for full-screen content relative to system UI elements. Use
`WebViewInset` in your app to select the desired inset for full-height/width
components. For details, see the
[Android Compose System Insets guide](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/system/insets).

| Inset | Description |
|-------|------------|
| None | No padding applied. |
| Status Bars | The insets describing the status bars. These are the top system UI bars containing notification icons and other indicators. |
| Navigation Bars | The insets describing the navigation bars. These are the system UI bars on the left, right, or bottom side of the device, describing the taskbar or navigation icons. These can change at runtime based on the user's preferred navigation method and interacting with the taskbar. |
| System Bars | The union of the system bar insets, which include the status bars, navigation bars, and caption bar. |
| Display Cutout | The insets representing the amount of spacing needed to avoid overlapping with a display cutout (notch or pinhole). |
| Safe Drawing | Insets representing safe drawing area that avoids system UI and cutouts. |
| Safe Gestures | Insets representing areas where system gestures are active and the app should avoid placing interactive elements. |
| Safe Content | Insets representing the safe content area where important UI should not be obscured by system UI. |

**Default:** System Bars

## 4. Immersive Mode

In immersive mode, your system bars (status and navigation) are hidden.

You can temporarily reveal the system bars with gestures such as swiping
from the edge of the screen where the bar is hidden from.

Note: immersive mode is enabled automatically when entering fullscreen
(for example, when watching a video), irrespective of this setting.

| Mode | Description |
|-------|------------|
| Always On | System bars are always hidden |
| Always Off | System bars are never hidden (unless in fullscreen) |
| Only when locked | System bars are only hidden when the device is in locked/pinned (kiosk) mode |
