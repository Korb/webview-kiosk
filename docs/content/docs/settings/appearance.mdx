import { APP_NAME } from '@/config/app';
import { Wrench } from 'lucide-react';

## Theme

Select one of:

1. System  
1. Dark  
1. Light  

If either Dark or Light is selected, custom JavaScript will be injected to override the `prefers-color-scheme` property of the WebView page.

**Default:** System

## Address Bar Mode

Select one of:

1. Hidden  
1. Hidden when locked  
1. Shown  

With `Hidden when locked`, the address bar will be visible in the default view, but disappears when the app is locked (pinned) using the floating toolbar <span className="inline-flex">(<Wrench className="-rotate-90"/>)</span>.

**Default:** Hidden when locked

## Blocked Message

The message to display when a URL matches the blacklist regex filter rule.

**Default:** This site is blocked by {APP_NAME}

## Window Insets

Controls padding for full-screen content relative to system UI elements. Use `WebViewInset` in your app to select the desired inset for full-height/width components. For details, see the [Android Compose System Insets guide](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/system/insets).

| Inset | Description |
|-------|------------|
| None | No padding applied. |
| Status Bars | The insets describing the status bars. These are the top system UI bars containing notification icons and other indicators. |
| Navigation Bars | The insets describing the navigation bars. These are the system UI bars on the left, right, or bottom side of the device, describing the taskbar or navigation icons. These can change at runtime based on the user's preferred navigation method and interacting with the taskbar. |
| System Bars | The union of the system bar insets, which include the status bars, navigation bars, and caption bar. |
| Display Cutout | The insets representing the amount of spacing needed to avoid overlapping with a display cutout (notch or pinhole). |
| Safe Drawing | Insets representing safe drawing area that avoids system UI and cutouts. |
| Safe Gestures | Insets representing areas where system gestures are active and the app should avoid placing interactive elements. |
| Safe Content | Insets representing the safe content area where important UI should not be obscured by system UI. |

**Default:** System Bars
