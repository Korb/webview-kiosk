## Home URL

Configure the Home URL, which can be returned to as per <a href="/docs/settings/web-browsing/#allow-go-home">`Web Browsing -> Allow Go Home`</a>.

## Blacklist & Whitelist Regex

Specify regular expressions (regex), one per line.
Escaping is required for special characters in regex like `.` and `?`.

These patterns also use partial matching.
If you need strict control, anchor your regex with `^` and `$`.

Whitelist patterns take precedence over blacklist patterns.

### Blacklist Example

Block all:

```
.*
```

Block google, including all subdomains and paths:

```
^https://.*\.?google\.com/?.*
```

### Whitelist Example

Allow `https://allowsite.com` home page and all subdomains and paths for `https://trusted.org` to bypass rules in the blacklist:
```
^https://trusted\.org/?$
^https://.*\.trusted\.org/?.*
```
