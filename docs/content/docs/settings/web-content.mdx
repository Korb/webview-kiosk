import { EllipsisVertical, Wrench } from 'lucide-react';

## Home URL

Configure the Home URL, which can be returned to using one of:

1. Tapping the screen 10 times in quick succession (if setting enabled)
1. Clicking the <span className="inline-flex">(<EllipsisVertical />)</span> icon on the right of the address bar (top-right corner of screen) and selecting `Home`
1. Clicking the floating toolbar <span className="inline-flex">(<Wrench className="-rotate-90 mx-2"/>)</span> icon and selecting `Home`

## Blacklist & Whitelist Regex

Specify regular expressions (regex), one per line.
Escaping is required for special characters in regex like `.` and `?`.

These patterns also use partial matching.
If you need strict control, anchor your regex with `^` and `$`.

Whitelist patterns take precedence over blacklist patterns.

### Blacklist Example

Block all:

```
.
```

Block google, including all subdomains and paths:

```
^https://.*\\.?google\\.com/.*
```

### Whitelist Example

Allow `https://allowsite.com` home page, and all subdomains and paths for `https://trusted.org`:
```
^https://allowedsite\\.com/?$
^https://.*\\.trusted\\.org/.*
```
