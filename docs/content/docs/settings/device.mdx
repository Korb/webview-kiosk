## 3. Allow Camera

Set to true to give WebView access to your device's camera.

You will need to grant the [CAMERA](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#CAMERA)
permission, which is required for the WebView's
[RESOURCE_VIDEO_CAPTURE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/PermissionRequest#RESOURCE_VIDEO_CAPTURE)
feature.

**Default:** false

## 4. Allow Microphone

[RESOURCE_AUDIO_CAPTURE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/PermissionRequest#RESOURCE_AUDIO_CAPTURE)
feature.

**Default:** false

## 5. Allow Location

When enabled, websites can request the device's location.

You can choose to request precise location (FINE) or approximate location (COARSE).

For more information, refer to
[location/permissions#accuracy](https://developer.android.com/develop/sensors-and-location/location/permissions#accuracy).

You will need to grant either
[ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)
or
[ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION),

**Default:** false

## 6. Back Button Hold Action

Customise the behaviour when the back button is held down (long pressed).

| Option                     | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|

| `DISABLED`                 | Do nothing (ignore long-press). |

**Default:** Open Kiosk Control Panel

## 7. Custom Unlock Shortcut

Provide a custom keyboard shortcut using a modifier key (CTRL/SHIFT/ALT/META)
in combination with another standard key to unlock/unpin the application.

For example, `CTRL+1`.

This is useful for devices with no navigation buttons on screen and instead
has a physical keyboard connected.

Please note that the short-cut will only trigger when there is no app-specific
dropdown/alerts opened (e.g. from floating toolbar, address bar or "go home"
confirmation dialog from multitap).

**Default:** *(blank)*

## 8. Unlock Auth Requirement

This setting only applies to in-app unlock methods, e.g. when unlocking
using `Kiosk Control Panel` or `Custom Unlock Shortcut`.

| Option   | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Default  | Require authentication for lock task mode (device owner, fully-managed/company-owned devices), off for screen pinning (user-owned devices). |
| Off      | Unlock without requiring authentication. |
| Require  | Prompt for biometrics or device credentials when unlocking. |

For user-owned devices without lock task mode, the device will auto-lock when
unpinning, which is outside the control of {APP_NAME}.

**Default:** Default
