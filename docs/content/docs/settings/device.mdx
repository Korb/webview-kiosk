## 1. Keep Screen On

Enable this option to keep your device awake (no screen timeout).

Useful if you have a kiosk application that should always remain active.

**Default:** false

## 2. Device Rotation

Select one of:

| Option | Orientation        | Description |
|--------|--------------------|-------------|
| Auto   | `unspecified`      | No preference specified: let the system decide the best orientation. |
| 0째     | `portrait`         | Would like to have the screen in a portrait orientation: display taller than wide, ignoring sensor data. |
| 90째    | `landscape`        | Would like to have the screen in a landscape orientation: display wider than tall, ignoring sensor data. |
| 180째   | `reversePortrait`  | Would like to have the screen in portrait orientation, turned in the opposite direction from normal portrait. |
| 270째   | `reverseLandscape` | Would like to have the screen in landscape orientation, turned in the opposite direction from normal landscape. |

For more details, refer to Android's official documentation for [R.attr.screenOrientation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#screenOrientation).

**Default:** Auto


## 3. Custom Unlock Shortcut

Provide a custom keyboard shortcut using a modifier key (CTRL/SHIFT/ALT/META)
in combination with another standard key to unlock/unpin the application.

For example, `CTRL+1`.

This is useful for devices with no navigation buttons on screen and instead
has a physical keyboard connected.

Please note that the short-cut will only trigger when there is no app-specific
dropdown/alerts opened (e.g. from floating toolbar, address bar or "go home"
confirmation dialog from multitap).
