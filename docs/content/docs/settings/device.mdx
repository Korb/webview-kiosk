## 1. Keep Screen On

Enable this option to keep your device awake (no screen timeout).

Useful if you have a kiosk application that should always remain active.

**Default:** false

## 2. Device Rotation

Select one of:

| Option | Orientation        | Description |
|--------|--------------------|-------------|
| Auto   | `unspecified`      | No preference specified: let the system decide the best orientation. |
| 0°     | `portrait`         | Would like to have the screen in a portrait orientation: display taller than wide, ignoring sensor data. |
| 90°    | `landscape`        | Would like to have the screen in a landscape orientation: display wider than tall, ignoring sensor data. |
| 180°   | `reversePortrait`  | Would like to have the screen in portrait orientation, turned in the opposite direction from normal portrait. |
| 270°   | `reverseLandscape` | Would like to have the screen in landscape orientation, turned in the opposite direction from normal landscape. |

For more details, refer to Android's official documentation for [R.attr.screenOrientation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#screenOrientation).

**Default:** Auto

## 3. Allow Camera

Set this option to true to allow the WebView to access the device camera.

This will enable the [RESOURCE_VIDEO_CAPTURE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/PermissionRequest#RESOURCE_VIDEO_CAPTURE) permission.

**Default:** false

## 4. Allow Microphone

Set this option to true to allow the WebView to access the device microphone.

This will enable the [RESOURCE_AUDIO_CAPTURE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/PermissionRequest#RESOURCE_AUDIO_CAPTURE) permission.

**Default:** false

## 5. Allow Location

Enable this option to allow the WebView to access the device’s location.

You can choose to request precise location (fine) or approximate location (coarse).  

For more information, refer to:

- [location/permissions#accuracy](https://developer.android.com/develop/sensors-and-location/location/permissions#accuracy)

**Default:** false


## 3. Custom Unlock Shortcut

Provide a custom keyboard shortcut using a modifier key (CTRL/SHIFT/ALT/META)
in combination with another standard key to unlock/unpin the application.

For example, `CTRL+1`.

This is useful for devices with no navigation buttons on screen and instead
has a physical keyboard connected.

Please note that the short-cut will only trigger when there is no app-specific
dropdown/alerts opened (e.g. from floating toolbar, address bar or "go home"
confirmation dialog from multitap).

**Default:** *(blank)*
