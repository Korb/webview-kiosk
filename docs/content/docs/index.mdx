Webview Kiosk is a free and open-source Android application designed for secure,
kiosk-style web browsing.

It allows device owners to lock the device to a single webview, restrict access
to other apps or system features, and provide flexible configuration options.

This app is intended for device owners seeking a simple solution without the need
for Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) or Mobile Device Management (MDM) systems.

## Key Features

- **Lock Task Mode (Pin):** prevent users from opening other apps or access the
  status bar. You can also enable the "Lock device when unpinning" feature to
  further enforce the security.
- **Protected Settings:** protect app settings with biometrics or device credentials
- **URL Filtering:** supports regex-based blacklist and whitelist to control web access.
- **Export/Import:** allow for backups of settings & configurations

For all configurable settings, view the `Settings` section.
