import { APP_NAME } from '@/config/app'

## 1. App Lock

In case your device credentials is bypassed or compromised, you may
find it worthwide to add another protection layer for sensitive applications.

For example, using [App Lock](https://github.com/PranavPurwar/AppLock),
an Open Source Android App Locker & Privacy Guard.

## 2. Location Tracking

In case the Kiosk device is lost or stolen, having a way to trace its location
can prove useful. 

### 2.1. FMD Android

Using [FMD Android](https://gitlab.com/fmd-foss/fmd-android), you can find your
device via SMS, instant messengers, or a web interface
([FMD Server](https://gitlab.com/fmd-foss/fmd-server)).

FMD allows you to locate, ring, wipe and issue other commands to your device when it's lost.
It aims to be a secure open source alternative to Google's Find Hub.

### 2.2. Google's Find Hub

Find Hub makes it easy to locate, ring, or wipe your device from the web, even when
they are offline. For more details, visit the
[App on Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.adm).

## 3. Terminal Emulator

While {APP_NAME} supports uploading local HTML files to the Android Webview, for
web applications that heavily utilises JavaScript/routing, e.g. a single-page app
built with React or Angular, this may not suffice.

In these advanced use cases, we recommend installing an android terminal like
[Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app), which can be used to host local
web servers accessible at `http://localhost:<YOUR_PORT>`.
