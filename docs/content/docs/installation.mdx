## 1. Google Play

You can download {APP_NAME} directly on the
<a href={PLAYSTORE_URL} target="_blank">Google Play Store</a>.

Alternatively, you can use the [Aurora Store](https://auroraoss.com/aurora-store),
a FOSS client to Google Play that works without needing Google Play Services or microG.

## 2. GitHub

<Callout title="NOTE">
  As of [v0.15.7](https://github.com/nktnet1/webview-kiosk/releases/tag/v0.15.7),
  the package name has changed from `com.nktnet.webview_kiosk` to `uk.nktnet.webviewkiosk`.
</Callout>

Signed APKs are available for download on the
<a href={urlJoin(GITHUB_URL, 'releases')} target="_blank">GitHub Releases</a> page.

To build the application from source, clone the <a href={GITHUB_URL} target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>, open
the project in Android Studio and follow the [official documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/run).

### 2.1. Obtanium

You can also use [Obtainium](https://obtainium.imranr.dev) to manage
installations and updates of {APP_NAME} on GitHub release page.

This has the added bonus of notifications when new releases are made
available.

### 2.2. F-Droid

{APP_NAME} is currently
[pending review on the F-Droid data repository](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/26746).

With [Reproducible builds](https://f-droid.org/docs/Reproducible_Builds)
enabled, once the app is officially published on F-Droid, the APK will be
identical to that of GitHub.
