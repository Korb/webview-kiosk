## Settings Authentication Session

The settings page is locked using the device's Biometrics or Credentials (if set).

Once unlocked, it will not prompt for login for the next 5 minutes.
This persisting session duration reset each time a settings page is accessed.

When the device is locked, or the app is exited or placed in the background,
the authentication session will be revoked.

## App Pinning

For better security, go to the App Pinning setting, tap into it to view more
options, then enable **Ask for PIN/pattern/password before unpinning**.

On some devices, it may be shown as **Lock device when unpinning** or equivalent.

This will ensure that users cannot unpin (and thus unlock) the kiosk view without
first entering your device biometrics or credentials.
