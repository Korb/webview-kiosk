## 1. Settings Authentication Session

The settings page is locked using the device's Biometrics or Credentials (if set).

Once unlocked, it will not prompt for login for the next 5 minutes.
This persisting session duration reset each time a settings page is accessed.

When the device is locked, or the app is exited or placed in the background,
the authentication session will be revoked.

## 2. App Pinning

For better security, go to the App Pinning setting, tap into it to view more
options, then enable **Ask for PIN/pattern/password before unpinning**.

On some devices, it may be shown as **Lock device when unpinning** or equivalent.

This will ensure that users cannot unpin (and thus unlock) the kiosk view without
first entering your device biometrics or credentials.

## 3. Default Launcher

By setting {APP_NAME} as the default launcher (home screen) app, any attempts to
leave the app will simply re-open it.

To do this, use the `Launcher` option in <Link href="/docs/setting-actions">Setting Actions</Link>.
