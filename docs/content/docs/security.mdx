## 1. Settings Authentication Session

The settings page is locked using the device's biometrics or credentials (if set).

Once unlocked, it will not prompt for login for the next 5 minutes.
This persisting session duration reset each time a settings page is accessed.

When the device is locked, or the app is exited or placed in the background,
the authentication session will be revoked.

## 2. Default Launcher

By setting {APP_NAME} as the default launcher (home screen) app, any attempts to
leave the app will simply re-open it.

To do this, use the `Launcher` option in <Link href="/docs/setting-actions">Setting Actions</Link>.

## 3. App Pinning / Lock Task Mode

### 3.1. User-owned Devices

On regular user-owned devices, to improve security, we recommend going to your device'same
App Pinning setting, tap into it (instead of toggling) to view more options, then enable
**Ask for PIN/pattern/password before unpinning**.

On some devices, it may be shown as **Lock device when unpinning** or equivalent.

This will ensure that users cannot unpin (and thus unlock) the kiosk view without
first entering the device's biometrics or credentials.

### 3.2. Device Owner

By setting {APP_NAME} as the device owner, it is possible to stop users from
triggering the "unpin" action altogether, thus removing the side-effect of the
device getting locked.

You can set/unset Webview Kiosk as the device owner using the Android Debug 
Bridge (ADB) commandline tool on a PC:

```sh
# Set Webview Kiosk as Device Owner
adb shell dpm set-device-owner uk.nktnet.webviewkiosk/.WebviewKioskAdminReceiver

# Set Webview Kiosk as Device Owner
adb shell dpm remove-active-admin uk.nktnet.webviewkiosk/.WebviewKioskAdminReceiver
```

Alternatively, you can use [shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku) and
[termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app) to obtain ADB access on your
device without a PC. Refer to
[GitHub Discussion #33](https://github.com/nktnet1/webview-kiosk/discussions/33#discussioncomment-14672999)
for a video demonstration.

### 3.3. Device Policy Controller

If you have control over your Device Policy Controller (or your MDM/EMM has provided
an interface to do so), you can simply add {APP_NAME} to the
allowlist of apps for lock task packages.

```kt
val APP_PACKAGES = arrayOf(
  // Choose one depending on your installation method:
  "uk.nktnet.webviewkiosk",   // GitHub, F-Droid, IzzyOnDroid, etc
  "com.nktnet.webview_kiosk", // Google Play
)

val dpm = context.getSystemService(Context.DEVICE_POLICY_SERVICE) as DevicePolicyManager
val adminName = getComponentName(context)
dpm.setLockTaskPackages(adminName, APP_PACKAGES)
```

For more information, see
[Android's official documentation](https://developer.android.com/work/dpc/dedicated-devices/lock-task-mode#allowlist_apps).

## 4. Managed App Configurations (Restriction Manager)

This feature is soon to come. See
[GitHub Discussion #35](https://github.com/nktnet1/webview-kiosk/discussions/35).
