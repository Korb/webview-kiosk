Webview Kiosk is a free and open-source Android application for secure,
kiosk-style web browsing.

The app is designed for small businesses and device owners who are looking for
a simpler alternative to Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) or Mobile Device
Management (MDM) systems.

## Key Features

- **Lock Task Mode (Pin):** prevent users from opening other apps or access the
  status bar. You can also enable the "Lock device when unpinning" feature to
  further enforce the security.
- **Protected Settings:** protect app settings with biometrics or device credentials
- **URL Filtering:** supports regex-based blacklist and whitelist to control web access.
- **Export/Import:** allow for backups of settings & configurations
