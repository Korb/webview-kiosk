## Breaking Change

Shared preference keys for custom JS scripts were renamed internally - they are now:
- js_scripts.custom_script_on_page_start
- js_scripts.custom_script_on_page_finish

Please back up your scripts (if any) before updating, e.g. using the export feature.
If you've upgraded by accident, you can simply downgrade to the previous version
and back up those scripts.
