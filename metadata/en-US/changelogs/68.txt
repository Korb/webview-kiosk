## New Features

1. feat: permission request per origin
    - permissions must now be granted explicitly per site/origin via the popup dialog.
    - you can retain permission for the origin by ticking the "remember" checkbox
    - retained permissions can be removed in "Web Browsing -> Site Permissions"

2. feat: replace history url on redirect (new setting under "Web Browsing")
    - resolves the back button needing to be clicked twice if the previous page
    was a redirect link.
    - more context: https://github.com/nktnet1/webview-kiosk/discussions/32
