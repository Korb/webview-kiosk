## New Feature: Immersive Mode 

> settings -> appearance -> immersive mode

In immersive mode, your system bars (status and navigation) are hidden.

You can temporarily reveal the system bars with gestures such as swiping
from the edge of the screen where the bar is hidden from.

Note: immersive mode is enabled automatically when entering fullscreen
(for example, when watching a video), irrespective of this setting.

| Mode | Description |
|-------|------------|
| Always On | System bars are always hidden |
| Always Off | System bars are never hidden (unless in fullscreen) |
| Only when locked | System bars are only hidden when the device is in locked/pinned (kiosk) mode |
