## New features

1. `Settings -> Device -> Back Button Hold Action` has been added. For now, you can
   configure the behaviour of long-presssing the back key to be one of:

   - Open Kiosk Control Panel
   - Go Home
   - Disabled

2. `Lock` action button added to kiosk control panel

3. Added sticky mode to kiosk control panel (enabled = don't auto-close dialog on action)

## Potentially Breaking Change

Kiosk control panel region key name has been renamed internally to

```
web_browsing.kiosk_control_panel_region
```

This means that the default region selection for multitap may get reset
to `Top Left` upon update, if you have modified this value.
