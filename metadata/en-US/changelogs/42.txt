Change:
- com.nktnet.webview_kiosk

To
- uk.nktnet.webviewkiosk

To match website:
- https://webviewkiosk.nktnet.uk

Since proof of domain ownership is required by Accrescent:
- https://accrescent.app/docs/guide/getting-started/new-app.html#domain-verification

Note that this patch currently only for F-Droid and Accrescent.

Google Play Store package name will remain as com.nktnet.webview_kiosk for the time
being, as it is not as trivial to change.
